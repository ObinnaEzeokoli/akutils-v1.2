Test of differential abundance in the R package ANCOM

Usage:
	ancomR.sh <input.biom> <mapping_file> <factor>

		<input.biom> must be biom-formatted OTU table with .biom extension
		<mapping_file> is QIIME-formatted sample mapping file
		<factor> is the metadata category you wish to test

This script takes a biom-formatted OTU table, a QIIME-formatted mapping file, 
and a factor listed in the mapping file and performs tests of differential
abundance across all OTUs. The test is conducted without multiple correction as
well as with FDR correction. A text file will be output for each test that will
have either a list of OTUs detected as significant (alpha = 0.05), or that no
significant OTUs were detected. When significant OTUs are observed, a pdf file
is also output with box plots of the significant comparisons. This script
requires that you have ANCOM installed within your R framework, as well as the
datamash utility and the biom command.

Known issues:
 1) when a pdf output is produced (significant OTUs present), there is sometimes
a final page stating that no significant OTUs were detected. In fact, the plots
are of significant OTUs, so ignore that last page.

 2) OTU tables with few OTUS (~10 or less) will not produce output.

 3) OTU IDs must not contain semicolons, while taxonomy must be delimited with
semicolon.
