### akutils join_paired_reads - join PE data with fastq-join from ea-utils

**Usage (order is important!!):**  

    akutils join_paired_reads <index1> <index2> <read1> <read2> <IndexLength> <fastq-join options>  
    
    <index2> is optional  
    <IndexLength> is an integer equaling the total number of index bases  
    <fastq-join options> as described in fastq-join documentation  

This script takes paired end fastq files with a separate index read(s) (3-4
input files) and joins the paired end reads where possible while keeping all
reads in phase.  Script will automatically determine whether you supply one or
two index reads.

**Output:**  
Output will be 2 files, an index file (idx.fq) and a read file (rd.fq).

**Example:**  

    akutils join_paired_reads index1.fq read1.fq read2.fq 12 -m 30 -p 10

This example is joining fastq files read1.fq and read2.fq while keeping reads
in sync with index1.fq.  The index read is 12 bases long, and it is calling
options to the fastq-join command as -m 30 (minimum overlap of 30 bases) and
-p 10 (10 percent allowable mismatch).

Requires the following dependencies to run:  
	1) ea-utils (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)  
	2) Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)
