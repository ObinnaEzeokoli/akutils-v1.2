{"name":"akutils-v1.2","tagline":"akutils with massive updates over v1.1 to functionality and command line interface.","body":"  \r\n  \r\n**akutils-v1.2 README**  \r\n\r\nThis is a collection of scripts I wrote to make myself more productive while\r\ndoing microbial ecology work with QIIME. I was having difficulty knowing that I\r\nwas making the best decisions in my analyses, so I started writing this as an\r\nexercise in getting to know better the QIIME commands that I was using. I can\r\nnow use it to run many OTU picking workflows in a row and it generates the plots\r\nand stats that I like to have access to right away. This avoids the tedium of\r\nentering many commands and helps to keep me organized. I do everything on a \r\nLinux system (Ubuntu 14.04). I have also tested most things on CentOS 6.6\r\n(monsoon cluster at NAU). You should be comfortable installing packages and such\r\nthat may be required. For more information on the functionality of akutils,\r\ncheck out the wiki pages:\r\n\r\n     https://github.com/alk224/akutils/wiki (non-dev pages only)  \r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nGetting akutils on your local system (workstation or VirtualBox):\r\n\r\n 1) Set up your system appropriately. I have done this on a large workstation as\r\nwell as within a VirtualBox on my netbook. Install Ubuntu 14.04LTS. I have had\r\ntrouble with 14.04.3 base installs so prefer 14.04.1 install and then update:  \r\n    http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.2/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso  \r\n\r\n2) Get all programs and dependencies installed. The easiest way is with my\r\ninstaller script:  \r\n    https://github.com/alk224/akutils_ubuntu_installer  \r\n\r\nInstructions are there to fix the screen size in a Virtualbox guest as well as\r\nto update and run all installation. This part takes a long time and requires a\r\ndecent internet connection.\r\n\r\n3) Clone the akutils-dev repository:\r\n\r\n     git clone https://github.com/alk224/akutils-dev  \r\n\r\n4) Run install script to add akutils to PATH and enable command autocompletion.\r\n\r\n     cd akutils-dev  \r\n     bash install  \r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nGetting akutils on your compute cluster:\r\n\r\n 1) No guarantees! This works on Ubuntu 14.04 and Centos 6.6. Maybe other \r\nsystems too.\r\n\r\n 2) Have your sysadmin install the necessary packages:\r\n\r\n    -- QIIME 1.9.1 (https://qiime.org)  \r\n    -- ea-utils (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)  \r\n    -- Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)  \r\n    -- vsearch (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)  \r\n    -- ITSx (http://microbiology.se/software/itsx/)  \r\n    -- Smalt (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/)  \r\n    -- HMMer v3+ (http://hmmer.janelia.org/)  \r\n    -- Mafft (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)  \r\n\r\n 3) Clone the repository and run the install script (steps 3-4 above).\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nIf you find any problems or have ideas for useful functionality, you can submit\r\nan issue via github:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/alk224/akutils/issues  \r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nUpdating:\r\n\r\nIf (when) I make useful changes, I will push them to the repo. To benefit from\r\nthese changes, navigate to your akutils directory and type:\r\n\r\n     git pull  \r\n\r\nAfter this, check your configuration:\r\n\r\n     akutils print_config  \r\n\r\nIf new configurable options are available, you will be instructed to run the\r\nconfig utility and choose \"rebuild\" to make a fresh global config file which\r\nwill contain the new options. Older config files may not function correctly\r\nafter an update. This can cause some scripts to miss a variable import without a\r\nconfig file to match the version of that script.\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nCiting akutils:\r\n\r\nAndrew Krohn. (2015). akutils: Facilitating analyses of microbial \r\ncommunities through QIIME. Zenodo. 10.5281/zenodo.18615\r\n\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n\r\nThings to change before next release:\r\n\r\n 1) Reorganize commands into a master script (completed 11/20/15)  \r\n 2) Command autocompletion (completed 11/20/15)  \r\n 3) Autodetection of single or dual indexes during joining (completed 11/23/15)  \r\n 4) Updated help and usage screens (in progress)  \r\n 5) Updated wiki  \r\n 6) Add ghost-tree to ITS align_and_tree command (made separate command 1/31/16)  \r\n 7) Add tree as configurable variable (completed 1/30/16)  \r\n 8) Improved workflow testing  \r\n 9) Improved core_diversity interface with collapsible panels (completed 12/15/15)  \r\n10) Phyloseq output in addition to QIIME output (in progress)  \r\n11) Full workflows for both rarefied and normalized data (completed (12/23/15)  \r\n12) Better handling of input tables, requiring only a single input (completed 12/23/15)  \r\n13) Better workflow logging (in progress)  \r\n14) One line commands to modify config settings  \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
