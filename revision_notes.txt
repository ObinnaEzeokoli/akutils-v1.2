In order to finish akutils, one last major revision needs to be applied.

Most of the changes will be in the otu_picking workflows.

They need to be unified into a single script and the picking method added
back to the config utility.  Additionally, the different tax assigners
need to all be made available through the config utility.

OTU pickers need to be able to pass in a parameters file.  The OTU picking
step will start by building a custom parameter file from the master parameter
file.  The master file will only differ from a QIIME parameter file by
allowing multiple similarities or resolutions.  THe workflow will build a
temporary file to store similarities or resolutions, then extract everything
else with negative grep to a new parameter file.  SInce this will be done
within a for loop based on the extracted similarities or resolutions, that
parameter can be passed to the new parameter file initially.

This ultimate OTU picking script should be built off of the dev-swarm workflow
that already uses vsearch and can do chimera filtering as well as ITSx.

Tax assigners need one adjustable parameter at least.  Capability to pass in
parames if possible.  RDP needs -c, BLAST e-value, uclust similarity.

The output directories need better organization.  Make a point to do more 
cleanup at the end of the workflow.

The akutils directory needs the scripts moved to a "scripts" folder.

Need the dependency check script to be made.
