<p>This is a collection of scripts I wrote to make myself more productive while
doing microbial ecology work with QIIME. I was having difficulty knowing that I
was making the best decisions in my analyses, so I started writing this as an
exercise in getting to know better the QIIME commands that I was using. I can
now use it to run many OTU picking workflows in a row and it generates the plots
and stats that I like to have access to right away. This avoids the tedium of
entering many commands and helps to keep me organized. I do everything on a 
Linux system (Ubuntu 14.04). I have also tested most things on CentOS 6.6
(monsoon cluster at NAU). You should be comfortable installing packages and such
that may be required. For more information on the functionality of akutils,
check out the wiki pages:</p>

<p>Getting akutils on your local system (workstation or VirtualBox):</p>

<p>1) Set up your system appropriately. I have done this on a large workstation as
well as within a VirtualBox on my netbook. Install Ubuntu 14.04LTS. I have had
trouble with 14.04.3 base installs so prefer 14.04.1 install and then update:<br>
    <a href="http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.2/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso">http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.2/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso</a>  </p>

<p>2) Get all programs and dependencies installed. The easiest way is with my
installer script:<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/alk224/akutils_ubuntu_installer">https://github.com/alk224/akutils_ubuntu_installer</a>  </p>

<p>Instructions are there to fix the screen size in a Virtualbox guest as well as
to update and run all installation. This part takes a long time and requires a
decent internet connection.</p>

<p>3) Clone the akutils-dev repository:</p>

<pre><code> git clone https://github.com/alk224/akutils-dev  
</code></pre>

<p>4) Run install script to add akutils to PATH and enable command autocompletion.</p>

<pre><code> cd akutils-dev  
 bash install  
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Getting akutils on your compute cluster:</p>

<p>1) No guarantees! This works on Ubuntu 14.04 and Centos 6.6. Maybe other 
systems too.</p>

<p>2) Have your sysadmin install the necessary packages:</p>

<pre><code>-- QIIME 1.9.1 (https://qiime.org)  
-- ea-utils (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)  
-- Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)  
-- vsearch (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)  
-- ITSx (http://microbiology.se/software/itsx/)  
-- Smalt (https://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/smalt/)  
-- HMMer v3+ (http://hmmer.janelia.org/)  
-- Mafft (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)  
</code></pre>

<p>3) Clone the repository and run the install script (steps 3-4 above).</p>

<hr>

<p>If you find any problems or have ideas for useful functionality, you can submit
an issue via github:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/alk224/akutils/issues  
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Updating:</p>

<p>If (when) I make useful changes, I will push them to the repo. To benefit from
these changes, navigate to your akutils directory and type:</p>

<pre><code> git pull  
</code></pre>

<p>After this, check your configuration:</p>

<pre><code> akutils print_config  
</code></pre>

<p>If new configurable options are available, you will be instructed to run the
config utility and choose "rebuild" to make a fresh global config file which
will contain the new options. Older config files may not function correctly
after an update. This can cause some scripts to miss a variable import without a
config file to match the version of that script.</p>

<p>Things to change before next release:</p>

<p>1) Reorganize commands into a master script (completed 11/20/15)<br>
 2) Command autocompletion (completed 11/20/15)<br>
 3) Autodetection of single or dual indexes during joining (completed 11/23/15)<br>
 4) Updated help and usage screens (in progress)<br>
 5) Updated wiki<br>
 6) Add ghost-tree to ITS align_and_tree command (made separate command 1/31/16)<br>
 7) Add tree as configurable variable (completed 1/30/16)<br>
 8) Improved workflow testing<br>
 9) Improved core_diversity interface with collapsible panels (completed 12/15/15)<br>
10) Phyloseq output in addition to QIIME output (in progress)<br>
11) Full workflows for both rarefied and normalized data (completed (12/23/15)<br>
12) Better handling of input tables, requiring only a single input (completed 12/23/15)<br>
13) Better workflow logging (in progress)<br>
14) One line commands to modify config settings  </p>
