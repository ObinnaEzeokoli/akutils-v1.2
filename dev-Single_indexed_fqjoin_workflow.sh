		This script takes paired end fastq files with a separate
		index read (3 input files) and joins the paired end reads
		where possible while keeping all reads in phase.  This is
		crucial for downstream use in certain applications (e.g.
		as inputs to QIIME).				

		Output will be 2 files, an index file (idx.fq) and a read
		file (rd.fq).

		Usage (order is important!!):
		Single_indexed_fqjoin_workflow.sh <IndexFastq> <Read1Fastq> <Read2Fastq> <IndexLength> <Fastq-join options>

		Example:
		Single_indexed_fqjoin_workflow.sh index1.fq read1.fq read2.fq 12 -m 30 -p 10

		This example is joining fastq files read1.fq and read2.fq 
		while keeping reads in sync with index1.fq.  The index read 
		is 12 bases long, and it is calling options to the fastq-join
		command as -m 30 (minimum overlap of 30 bases) and -p 10
		(10 percent allowable mismatch).

		Requires the following dependencies to run:
		1) ea-utils (https://code.google.com/p/ea-utils/)
		2) Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/)
		
		Citing ea-utils: Erik Aronesty (2011). ea-utils: Command-line tools for processing biological sequencing data; http://code.google.com/p/ea-utils
