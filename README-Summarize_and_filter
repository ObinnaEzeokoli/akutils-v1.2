I made this for me so that I could quickly summarize technical replicates
within an OTU table, summing their total sequencing counts, and presumably
improving statistical power by diminishing randomness in the data.  Maybe
it helps you too.

To call the script, place it in your path, and type its name:

summarize_and_filter.sh
